   <br>
<b>Important: it only works with JDK 8 or higher</b>
<br>
This plugin lets you <b>view previous values of variables and the complete stack traces when they were set</b>
<br>
<b>Manual (Help):</b>
<br>
<p><b>Just use the new RED debug runner which has a yellow arrow around it.</b> When a breakpoint is hit, right click on the field of a class you want to inspect
and then choose -> See Variable History.... If no variable history has been saved for that field, an error message will pop up, else several tabs(max 3) will open up
showing the history of the variable. On the left hand side you can navigate the stack trace.</p>
<br>
<b>Notes:</b>
<br>
History is only included for fields and not local variables (the purpose of the plugin is to know where fields have been set - local variables have a narrow scope
so it makes no sense to track them).
For performance and memory usage reasons, variable history is only included for primitive fields(int, long, char etc.) and their boxed types(Integer, Long, Character etc.)
and for <b>String</b>. For other types, stack traces are still included so you know where the variable has been set the last time.

<br>
<br>
<b>Why to use it:</b>
<br>

<ul>
    <li>Makes debugging a lot easier. Have you ever wondered what was the last value of a certain field before it was set?
    </li>
    <li>Have you ever wondered where the value of a field came from (who set that value)?
    </li>
</ul>
<br>
<b>Limitations:</b>
Execution overhead is very small (2-3%), but memory consumption can be +40-50%.
